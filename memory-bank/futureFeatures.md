## Future Features

1. **AI Integration**: 
   - Integrate with existing AI chatbots via MCP (Model Context Protocol).
   - Develop an MCP server to expose useful information to AI chatbots that support MCP.

2. **Testing and Consistency**:
   - Ensure consistency in how developers checkout code for any project.
   - Enforce software quality through testing and maintain versioned data models.

3. **Data-Centric Software Development**:
   - Emphasize the core data model as the primary concern.
   - Assist users in versioning their data models in the `data_models` folder.
   - Maintain autogenerated libraries from data models, regenerating and releasing them as needed.

4. **Subproject Creation**:
   - Integrate custom or community-driven cookiecutter templates for creating subprojects.
   - Example: `metarepo subproject create --from-template fastapi-py`.

5. **Code Generation Tools**:
   - Integrate tools like Connexion to generate FastAPI code from OpenAPI specs.

6. **Deeper Integration with GitHub/GitLab**:
   - Facilitate the creation of repositories within an organization.

7. **Infrastructure as Code Integration**:
   - Plugin for managing infrastructure configurations across the monorepo
   - Support for multiple IaC tools (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.)
   - Version control and state management for infrastructure
   - Automated infrastructure testing and validation
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure changes

8. **Virtual Filesystem Features**:
   - Mount documentation from multiple subprojects
   - Unified view of distributed resources
   - Custom filesystem providers for specialized use cases
