# MetaRepos Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### 1. Project Setup
- Create cookiecutter template for new monorepo projects
- Implement basic project structure
- Set up uv-based Python environment management

### 2. Event Management System
- Implement central event management process using ZeroMQ
- Define event schema and namespacing
- Implement event logging system
- Create basic event types for core functionality

### 3. CLI Framework
- Implement base CLI structure
- Create core commands:
  - `metarepo health`
  - `metarepo status`
  - `metarepo plugin list/install/uninstall/enable/disable`

## Phase 2: Plugin System

### 1. Plugin Infrastructure
- Define plugin structure and metadata format
- Implement plugin discovery and loading
- Create plugin lifecycle management
- Implement plugin configuration system

### 2. Core File System Plugin
- Implement filesystem monitoring
- Define and emit filesystem events
- Create basic file operation handlers

### 3. Plugin Provider System
- Implement git-based plugin provider
- Create plugin version management
- Implement plugin dependency resolution

## Phase 3: Core Plugins and Integration

### 1. Project Generation
- Implement subproject creation system
- Add cookiecutter template integration
- Create GitHub/GitLab integration

### 2. MCP Integration
- Implement MCP server plugin
- Create monorepo information providers
- Add AI chatbot integration capabilities

### 3. Data Model Support
- Implement data model versioning
- Create code generation system
- Add model consistency checks

### 4. Testing and Refinement
- Comprehensive testing of core features
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and examples

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 1. Virtual Filesystem Support
- Create virtual filesystem interface
- Implement basic virtual filesystem provider
- Add support for plugin-based filesystem extensions

### 2. Documentation Plugin
- Implement docs virtual filesystem
- Create documentation aggregation system
- Add basic search capabilities

### 3. Infrastructure as Code Integration
- Support for multiple IaC tools
- Version control and state management
- Infrastructure testing and validation

## Questions to Address During Implementation

### Event System
1. How should event replay/recovery be handled?
2. What's the strategy for handling event system failures?
3. How to manage event versioning as plugins evolve?

### Plugin System
1. How to handle plugin conflicts?
2. What's the security model for plugin execution?
3. How to manage plugin-specific dependencies?

### Performance
1. How to optimize event distribution for large monorepos?
2. What's the strategy for handling large numbers of plugins?
3. How to manage resource usage across multiple plugin services?

## Success Criteria
1. Core system is stable and performant
2. Plugin system is flexible and secure
3. Event system handles failures gracefully
4. Documentation is comprehensive
5. Basic plugins demonstrate system capabilities
