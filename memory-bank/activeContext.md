  - Added proper package structure for cli and core modules
  - Fixed cookiecutter template variables
  - Improved test script with proper environment setup
- Fixed test structure and imports:
  - Updated test imports to use absolute imports
  - Created proper Python package structure for tests
  - Added test configuration and fixtures
  - Fixed environment setup for tests
  - Added time freezing fixture for date-based tests
- Improved dependency management:
  - Moved dev dependencies to project.optional-dependencies
  - Added pytest configuration in pyproject.toml
  - Updated test script to use [dev] extra
  - Added GitPython dependency for plugin provider
  - Added toml dependency for configuration
  - Added freezegun for datetime mocking
- Fixed test issues:

  - Implemented event callback system
  - Added subscriber task management
  - Improved event routing and delivery
  - Added error handling for callbacks
  - Fixed subscription tests
  - Added local mode for testing
  - Fixed duplicate event delivery
- Improved template configuration:
  - Added _copy_without_render for plugin template
  - Fixed plugin template directory handling
  - Prevented template rendering in plugin templates
- Enhanced test script:
  - Added plugin template verification
  - Added directory structure checks
  - Improved error handling and reporting
  - Added cleanup of test output
  - Added virtual environment management
  - Added package installation verification

### Current Focus
1. Testing the template generation:
   - Project structure verification
   - Package installation with dependencies
   - Test execution and coverage
   - Environment setup validation
   - Plugin template verification

### Next Steps
1. Run and debug the test script
2. Create example core plugins:
   - File system monitor
   - Project generation
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Document plugin development process

### Testing Strategy
1. Package Structure:
   - Proper Python package hierarchy
   - Correct import paths
   - Test package organization
   - Fixture management
   - Plugin template structure

2. Dependency Management:
   - Core dependencies in project.dependencies
   - Dev dependencies as optional extra
   - Test script requirements
   - Virtual environment setup
   - Build dependencies

3. Unit Tests:
   - Core system components with proper mocking
   - Configuration validation
   - Plugin lifecycle management
   - Event system with datetime handling
   - Proper test isolation and cleanup
   - Event subscription and routing

4. Integration Tests:
   - Event system communication
   - Plugin interactions
   - Configuration handling
   - File system operations
   - Asynchronous event handling
   - Template generation

### Current Issues
1. Need to verify test environment setup
2. Need to run test script with updated structure
3. Need to verify test coverage configuration
4. Need to check dependency installation
5. Need to verify plugin template handling
