### Project Status
1. CLI Implementation
   - Complete CLI functionality with commands:
     * health: Check system health
     * status: Show component status
     * plugin: Manage plugins (list, install, uninstall, enable, disable)
   - Test coverage at 86% for CLI
   - All CLI tests passing
   - Error handling and edge cases covered
   - Environment handling improved
   - Path resolution fixed
   - Configuration management working

2. Core Components
   - Events System:
     * Schema: 100% coverage
     * Logger: 82% coverage
     * Manager: 62% coverage
     * Needs documentation on event flow
   - Plugin System:
     * Schema: 86% coverage
     * Loader: 23% coverage
     * Provider: 21% coverage
     * Manager: 16% coverage
     * Needs documentation on plugin lifecycle

3. Documentation Status
   - Need to improve:
     * Plugin development guide
     * Event system documentation
     * Architecture overview
     * Component interaction diagrams
     * Setup and configuration guide
     * Development workflow
     * Testing strategy

   - Document testing strategy

2. Future Development:
   - Improve core component coverage
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Add more plugin examples
   - Enhance event handling
   - Improve error recovery

### Architecture Overview
1. Core Components:
   - Event System:
     * Manager: Handles event routing
     * Logger: Provides event logging
     * Schema: Defines event structure
   - Plugin System:
     * Manager: Handles plugin lifecycle
     * Provider: Manages plugin discovery
     * Loader: Handles plugin loading
     * Schema: Defines plugin structure

2. Component Interaction:
   - Event Flow:
     * Event creation and validation
     * Event routing and handling
     * Event logging and monitoring
   - Plugin Lifecycle:
     * Discovery and registration
     * Loading and initialization
     * Enabling and disabling
     * Uninstallation and cleanup

3. Configuration:
   - Environment Variables:
     * METAREPOS_CONFIG: Config file path
     * METAREPOS_PLUGIN_DIR: Plugin directory
     * METAREPOS_LOG_DIR: Log directory
   - Config File:
     * Core settings
     * Event settings
     * Plugin settings
     * Logging settings

### Testing Strategy
1. Coverage Goals:
   - CLI Main: 86% → 90%
   - Core Events Schema: 100% (maintain)
   - Core Plugin Schema: 86% → 90%
   - Core Events Logger: 82% → 90%
   - Core Events Manager: 62% → 80%
   - Core Plugin Loader: 23% → 80%
   - Core Plugin Provider: 21% → 80%
   - Core Plugin Manager: 16% → 80%

2. Testing Focus:
   - Plugin System:
     * Loading and initialization
     * State management
     * Error handling
   - Event System:
     * Event routing
     * Error cases
     * Performance
   - Configuration:
     * Validation
     * Error handling
     * Defaults

### Current Issues
1. Documentation:
   - Missing plugin development guide
   - Incomplete event system docs
   - Need architecture diagrams
   - Missing setup guide
   - Incomplete testing docs

2. Coverage:
   - Low plugin system coverage
   - Event manager needs improvement
   - Missing error case tests
   - Edge case coverage needed

3. Development:
   - CI/CD pipeline needed
   - More plugin examples needed
   - Better error recovery needed
   - Performance monitoring needed
