   - Plugin management testing
   - Error case handling
   - Environment variable testing
   - Configuration file testing
   - Directory status testing

4. Integration Tests:
   - Event system communication

   - Configuration handling
   - File system operations
   - Asynchronous event handling
   - Template generation
   - Plugin template verification
   - CLI workflow testing
   - Environment setup testing
   - Plugin state management

5. Coverage Goals:
   - Minimum 80% overall coverage
   - Branch coverage tracking
   - Missing line reporting
   - Separate core and CLI coverage
   - Combined coverage reporting
   - Coverage exclusions for boilerplate
